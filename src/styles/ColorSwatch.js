  If I think of a book-- capital b book --I think of a big, blue, hardback Book.
  The cover has words in harder and lighter fonts with a light yellow bookmark.
  It's a beautiful book and I want 3 copies of it, each with different trim.
  A library app should invoke the idea of a Book in the user. These color codes
  are taken from Google's material design guidelines.
